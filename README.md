#Overview
#This mod will be a major rework and rebalance of Governors and their respective titles, adding unique improvements for each of them, each with additional benefits if the respective governor or upgraded Liang is in the city; also add unique buildings that allows for minor city specialization, granting effects even when the governors leave the city.
#Goals
# -Give players more clear and distinct options when assigning Governor titles. 
# - Have Governors take a more active role during gameplay and city planning, instead of the currently majorly passive and set-it-then-forget-it approach.
# -Have cities more uniquely structured in such a way that you can specialize them for certain functions, based on Governor titles, their unique alternative building, and unique improvements. 
# Specifications
# This mod will work in three major fronts, while keeping the same gameplay mechanic of acquiring Governor titles throughout the game. 
# Reworked Governors
# This is the basis for the mod. Governors as they currently are - aside from minorly Magnus Viktor and Amani - can be set in a single city for the duration of the whole game and have a major passive effect for that city. But this is a boring and non-interactive approach. Shifting the passive perk options for more active alternatives down below will bring the players more strategies they can use towards their desired goal. 
# Governors will have most of their powers shifted, giving them more defined and differing roles. Governors will also have passive synergistic effects with other governors’ infrastructure, allowing the player to adjust their Governor layout for the city’s needs and goals.  
# Mutually-exclusive, unique Governor buildings, A.K.A. more City Specialization
# Starting from the first title a particular governor has, the player will unlock a unique alternative basic or advanced Governor building that can be built in any City Center. Every governor has a mutually exclusive unique building, meaning once one Governor building for that tier is built, you cannot build another unique Governor building unlocked by another Governor. Basic Governor buildings will have minor effects and yields, allowing a city to fulfill its basic needs with ease.
# Later in the Governor perk tree, the advanced building for that governor is unlocked, and it can only be built if that city has a basic Governor building AND the Governor is active within the city you wish to build. Advanced Governor buildings will have major effects only for that particular city, not as powerful but similar to Government Plaza and Diplomatic Quarter’s buildings.
# Mixing and matching basic and advanced Governor buildings from multiple Governors is possible, as long as they are unlocked and their requirements are met.
# Unique governor improvements for every Governor

# Not unlike Liang’s Fishery and City park, every governor will have at least one unique improvement. These improvements will have minor yields and effects, but will also gain bonus yields if a Governor is within a city, and bonus yields differ based on which governor is within the city.
